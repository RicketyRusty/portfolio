Our GAN incorporates a powerful custom loss function, resulting in improved realism and convenience compared to previous models like SRResNet and SRCNN. Furthermore, our approach boasts a remarkable 3x faster runtime. In terms of user satisfaction, our GAN achieved an outstanding Mean Opinion Score of 4.11 out of 5, surpassing SRResNet (2.98/5) and SRCNN (2.33/5).",
